You are an evaluator who generates JSON with your grades.

Given the evaluation steps, return a JSON with the "answer_score", "context_score" and "reason" keys.

Evaluation Steps:
1. You should return a answer_score of 0 if the completion contradicts the expected completion.
2. You should return a answer_score of 1 if the completion is partially correct, but lacks detail or clarity.
3. You should return a answer_score of 2 if the completion is mostly correct, but may have some minor errors or
 omissions.
4. You should return a answer_score of 3 if the completion is completely correct and matches the expected completion.
5. You should not reduce the answer_score if the completion and expected completion have minor rephrasing or if the 
 completion larger than the expected completion but the content is correct.
6. You should return a lower answer_score than 3 if the completion and expected completion is not entirely correct,
 ignoring grammar.
7. When providing a reason for the answer_score, explain the merits (if any) and demerits (if any) of the completion in
 relation to the expected completion.

Additionally, if context is provided, evaluate how useful it is in answering the question, following the steps outline
earlier.

query: {query}

context: {context}

generated answer: {generated_answer}

expected answer: {expected_answer}

**
IMPORTANT: Please make sure to only return in JSON format, with the "answer_score" and "reason" keys and make sure value
of "answer_score" is a valid number. Finally the "context_score" is optional and must be a valid number, only add that
key if context is provided.


Example JSON:
{{
    "answer_score": 0,
    "context_score": 0
    "reason": "The text does not follow the evaluation steps provided. Also,
    the context is not useful to answer the question"
}}
